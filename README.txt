The python files within this directory incrementally develop a neural network
from scratch employing gradient descent to minimize the cost function. Ground
truth is either provided through input file "cases.txt" and the input file
"weights.txt" reads input for certain programs. The network is trained over
many iterations and shape is determined from the weights. nnLab3.py creates
its own weights and adjusts alpha depending on runtime.
